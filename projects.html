                        Let everyone understand you!
                    </h3>
                    <p class="project-post-meta">
                        The idea for this app came from my own language-learning
                        experience. Whenever I would chat with a person who
                        speaks another language, but with whom I don't have any
                        common language, it becomes really hard to communicate.
                        I thought it would be a good idea to make an app which
                        lets you translate messages on the fly, since this is
                        possible to do today. By utilizing already great
                        translation API services, such as IBM's Watson
                        translate, Yandex, or Google's translation API, client
                        is able to convert incoming/outgoing messages to
                        whatever language he/she would like. If, for example, I
                        am texting a German native speaker who finds it easier
                        to type in German than in English, I am able to set all
                        of my incoming messages to be translated to English, or
                        he/she can set all of his/her outgoing messages to be
                        translated to English. You get the idea.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-post-meta">
                        I believe that this app will help people who are
                        passionate about learning a new language, like myself,
                        and if nothing, at least ease the communication between
                        people.

                        This app uses Battle.net API to get various information

                        RxJava, as well as OAuth 2.0 authentication to log the
                        user to his/her World of Warcraft account. For example:
                        you can obtain game information about bosses, quests,
                        zones, other people's characters, etc... You can also
                        see log in to your Blizzard WoW account to get
                        interesting statistics about your own characters, such
                        as: how much dmg you've dealt with a character, how many
                        PvPs did you go to, wins/losses, etc...
